  "bio": "I'm a software engineer who values collaboration and continuous growth, a precisionist who can shoulder a heavy workload without missing a beat â€” or a deadline! I don't care about doing things my way, but I care a lot about doing things well.<br /><br />Three qualities I'm most proud of: my work ethic, curiosity, and compassion.<br /><br />I'm eager to create programs and tools that reshape the way we learn and communicate. My hope is that what we build is always built with people of all abilities and all backgrounds in mind. With new technology, we can create space for people who haven't historically been seen and help amplify the voices of people who haven't historically been heard.<br /><br />Outside of work, you'll likely find me at home practicing German (Guten Tag!), coloring or painting (poorly), watching true crime documentaries, or playing with my two cats, Puppy and Birdie..<br /><br />I encourage you to take a peek at my recommendations below for firsthand impressions from my teammates and managers..<br /><br />Feel free to say hi (or hallo) at <a href='mailto:okjill@gmail.com' />!",
